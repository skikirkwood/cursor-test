# Contentful Value Messaging Framework

## Framework Context

Our value messaging framework (VMF) equips the entire field team with a unified way to communicate Contentful's value. It is grounded in Force Management's Command of the Message and provides a common structure to uncover customer pain, connect it to consequences and tie Contentful directly to measurable business outcomes. The goal is simple: move beyond features and consistently focus on business impact in every sales conversation.

Use this framework to guide how you position value in sales & success conversations. It will serve as the foundation for the sales assets you rely on every day, from discovery guides to proposal decks to Salesforce fields and differentiation. The concepts and language here will ensure we all tell the same, consistent value story that increases deal sizes and accelerates velocity.

## Key Terms

- **Value Driver**: The high-level business outcomes your target buyers care most about, such as increasing revenue, reducing cost, minimising risk, and improving customer experience.
- **Differentiators**: The unique, superior or defensible capabilities or attributes of your solution that are important to the customer, different from the competition, and provable, especially in relation to the customer's required capabilities and achieving desired outcomes
- **Current State**: The customer's existing situation or environment, including challenges, limitations, inefficiencies, or risks, that are preventing them from achieving their desired business outcomes.
- **Negative Consequences**: The risks or costs the customer faces if they remain in the current state (what are the implications of doing nothing). These could include lost revenue, wasted resources, poor customer experience, or falling behind competitors.
- **Future State**: The improved environment the customer can achieve with your solution, the vision of success that addresses the current pain and unlocks value.
- **Positive Business Outcomes**: The measurable improvements a customer will realize by moving to the future state. These tie directly to the Value Drivers and justify the investment.
- **Required Capabilities**: The critical capabilities the customer must have in place to achieve the desired outcomes. These are framed from the buyer's perspective, not product features. The key is to influence the required capabilities based on our defensible differentiators.
- **Metrics for Success**: The KPIs or benchmarks the customer uses to define what success looks like. These help you anchor value in measurable terms.
- **How Contentful Does It**: This is where you map Contentful's capabilities to the customer's Required Capabilities connecting the dots between their needs
- **How Contentful Does It Better**: How Contentful uniquely delivers the required capabilities more effectively than alternatives, based on our defensible differentiators. This highlights why Contentful is the best choice to achieve the customer's desired outcomes.
- **Proof Points**: Evidence that supports your claims, like case studies, data, ROI models, or customer logos, that demonstrate how you've delivered similar value to other companies.
- **Discovery Questions**: Strategic, open-ended questions used to uncover the customer's current state, pain points, goals, and required capabilities. These are critical for diagnosing value and driving deeper conversations.

## Overview of Value Drivers

### Revenue Growth: Accelerating Business Performance

Disconnected content systems and reliance on IT stall campaign launches and make personalization hard for marketing teams. Contentful brings all content into an API-first hub and gives marketers self-serve tools to build, test, and tailor experiences quickly. This agility turns slow rollouts into rapid releases and lifts both conversion and digital revenue.

**Target Personas:**
- CMOs and VPs of Marketing - focused on pipeline growth and campaign ROI
- Heads of Digital & eCommerce - tasked with increasing conversion rates and customer spend
- Directors of Growth or Performance Marketing - who need agility to optimize targeting and drive ROAS

### Operational Efficiency: Doing More with Less

Manual workflows, multiple CMSs, and developer ticket backlogs slow releases and inflate content costs. A single structured platform with a visual editor lets marketers publish independently while developers focus on higher-value work. The streamlined process cuts spend and shortens launch cycles dramatically.

**Target Personas:**
- Heads of Marketing or Web Operations - want to reduce handoffs and accelerate content delivery
- Directors or VPs of Engineering and Platform - looking to minimize maintenance overhead and reliance on custom builds
- Directors of Finance or Procurement - care about lowering TCO and consolidating vendors

### Risk Mitigation: Reducing Business & Technical Risk

Legacy stacks expose businesses to outages, traffic-spike failures, and security or compliance gaps. Contentful's cloud-native architecture delivers high availability, rapid rollback, and strong governance controls such as SSO and RBAC. The result is greater resilience and the freedom to innovate without fear of disruption.

**Target Personas:**
- CISO/CTO/CIO - ensuring compliance and protecting enterprise systems
- Legal and Compliance Directors or Counsel - who value governance and auditability
- Enterprise Architecture Directors or VPs - benefit from focus on extensibility and mitigating vendor lock-in risk

### Customer Experience: Elevating Engagement & Loyalty

Siloed channels, limited personalization, and sluggish pages erode engagement and push visitors away. Composable delivery, reusable components, and native personalization create fast, consistent, and relevant journeys across every touchpoint. Teams that adopt this approach see deeper engagement, higher conversions, and stronger loyalty.

**Target Personas:**
- CMOs and VPs of Marketing
- Heads or Directors of Digital Experience/UX - prioritize faster iteration and consistent design
- Heads of Personalization or CRM - care about delivering targeted, real-time experiences
- Heads of Support or CX Operations - value accurate content that improves CSAT and deflects support volume

## Value Messaging Frameworks

### Revenue Growth: Accelerating Business Performance

#### Current State
- Multiple disconnected content systems make it slow and costly to launch new digital initiatives (e.g. weeks or months to spin up a new campaign or site)
- Marketers rely on IT for nearly every content change, limiting agility and causing missed market opportunities
- Personalization is minimal or absent due to limited data or tooling, resulting in campaigns that are broad and generic, failing to convert target audiences
- Experimentation is constrained due to limited testing and analytics, leaving marketers unable to optimize campaigns or refine messaging in real time
